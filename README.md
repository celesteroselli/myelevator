>"Everyone should be able to do one card trick, tell two jokes, and recite three poems, in case they are ever trapped in an elevator."

-Lemony Snicket

I used to be afraid of elevators. Now I love them. Embrace the waiting time. Make new friends. This website is a guide to doing just that. In the rare case you *do* find yourself trapped in an elevator, this site provides the following:
1. one card trick
2. two jokes
3. three poems

All of which are elevator themed. Except the card trick. There aren't very many elevator-themed card tricks. If you create one and want it featured, email me because I'd personally love to see that.

## Site creation
